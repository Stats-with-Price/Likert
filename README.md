DESCRIPTION:
This is an Excel sheet made to calculate means and standard deviations for Likert Scales given only their frequencies.
Oftentimes in Structural Equation Modeling, authors forget to put these important summary statistics.
Having the mean and standard deviations of variables allows researchers to analyze results from just the
correlation matrix alone (if Maximum Liklihood Estimation is used), allowing reviewers more transparency to the research process.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Within the "levels" column, put a number for each item in your Likert Scale.
2. Within the "frequency" column, put the amount of people who reported that level.
3. Look at the Summary Statistics!

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If you put in a Likert Scale with more than 6 items, the Histogram will not show the other levels.
To fix this, you can:
1. Click the graph.
2. Click "Chart Design" at the top of the screen.
3. Click "Select Data."
4. Under the "Horzinal (Category) Axis Labels), scroll and click the non-empty boxes.
If you see any other issues, please leave a comment here or send me an email @price.1861@osu.edu.

ADVANCED:
If you want to use another Excel Data Analysis Toolpack to measure other statistics like kurtosis or conduct
a Shaprio-Wilk test, right-click the "Input" sheet, then click unhide for the "Levels" sheet.
From there, you can see all of the columns for your variable and conduct further analyses as you please!

AKNOWLEDGEMENTS: 
This Sheet was made for Ohio State's SOCWORK 8405 course, Structural Equation Modeling.
Thank you to Dr. Natasha Bowen for teaching this wonderful course and asking if I could
develop this calculator for future students!
I would also like to thank Dr. Kuang, Dr. Green, and Dr. Shi for developing an online
calculator that I used to cross-check if my functions were working properly!
